| **NAME** and the **LINK** to original page | short **DESCRIPTION** to explain the purpose | as possible as we can to find the `gif` or image to undestand how it works |

Developer invented tools to make the work better, what I want to do is simply record and share what I used to use.
Give me a :star: if this collection helps you too. I'll be happy that this documentation is useful.
